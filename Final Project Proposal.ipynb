Therefore, base on information that we collected from basic analysis of the dataset and topic from past datafest we decide our problem as following:\n",

    "As mentioned above, we use Datafest 2018 as our data set for this project. This dataset provides information about job postings, including company details, job attributes, descriptions, requirements, and user engagement metrics such as clicks. It allows for analysis of factors influencing job popularity, salary estimation, and industry trends, among other potential insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all types of the data that had been collected, we decide to narrow it down to: \n",
    "\n",
    "+ date: Unixtime date when events occurred.\n",
    "+ companyId: ID of the company associated with the job posting.\n",
    "+ jobId: ID of the job posting.\n",
    "+ country: Country of the job posting.\n",
    "+ stateProvince: Name of the state or province of the job posting.\n",
    "+ city: Name of the city of the job posting.\n",
    "+ normTitle: Normalized or canonical job title.\n",
    "+ normTitleCategory: Category or occupational category of the normalized job title.\n",
    "+ estimatedSalary: Estimated annual salary for the job. 0 if estimate is not available.\n",
    "+ salaryCurrency: urrency used for the salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll construct a few charts to quickly parse the dataset after data cleaning. In order to intuitively identify the general requirements of different profession categories, frequency of normTitleCategory will sort the frequency of normTitleCategory. Number of occurrences for each stateThe entire number of jobs in each US region will be visually sorted and displayed by Province (US) so that we can see the total number of occupational needs in the US regions. The top 10 cities in California with the highest occupational demand will be determined by tallying and sorting each city's occupational demand. The top 10 cities with strong occupational demand in various regions can be determined using the same facts when looking at TX, FL, NY, and other locations.  Mean Salary by Job Category allows us to visualize the average salary for each type of occupation.\n",

    "#### Relevant features\n",
    "\n",
    "Base on the analysis from EDA, we found out that the most frequent job that has been posted on indeed is relevent to management, retail and sale. Also, jobs that have the highset average salary from the dataset is medical doctor, techsoftware, engid and engmech.\n",
    "\n",
    "After breakdown the dataset by country and state, we find out that most job in US are from California, Texas, New York and Florida. Los Angeles, New York, Orlanda and Houston are some of the major city that has the most opportunity that hiring.\n",
    "\n",
    "These significant features can help us to provide suggestion to students on city that they might want to study in university or major that they would like to take while in university."
